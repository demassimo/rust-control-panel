# Agent guidelines

Welcome to the Rust Control Panel repository. This project delivers a Node.js backend paired with a static JavaScript frontend
that together provide a management dashboard for Rust game servers.

## How the project is structured

- **Backend (`backend/`)** – Express + Socket.IO service handling authentication, RCON connectivity, database access, and optional
  Discord integration.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)** – Static HTML/CSS/JS bundle that renders the dashboard and consumes real-time data from the backend.
- **Deployment (`deploy/`, `scripts/`, `docker-compose.yml`)** – Operational assets used to install or host the panel.
- **Documentation (`docs/`, `FILES.md`)** – Living references that describe the system architecture and file inventory.

## Documentation expectations

When you add or modify modules, consult `docs/module-architecture-guide.md` for placement rules and update it if you introduce a
new pattern. Keep `docs/module-usage-report.md` aligned with the current code so that unused files are easy to spot. Note that the
Rust server status surface lives exclusively under the **Server workspace → Settings** view, while the Discord ticketing and
authentication tools remain anchored to the main dashboard's **Discord** tab—documentation should reflect those established UI
locations.

## Coding conventions

- Prefer small, focused modules that export explicit functions.
- Remove dead code rather than leaving unused files around.
- Update relevant documentation (`FILES.md`, the module usage report, and the architecture guide) whenever you add, move, or
  delete modules.

Following these notes ensures the repository stays easy to navigate for future contributors.
